-----------------

My personal collection of Haxe core libraries.

Functional style used where possible:
* Simple types.
* Functions are grouped into libraries using static classes.
* Libraries are as pure as possible, avoid state and side effects.

Tested on JavaScript, but should work with other platforms.

See spec classes in test directory tree for examples of how to use the libraries.

Make sure you run ``git submodule update --init`` to clone the dependent libraries.
